Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 points) Briefly explain why a common GND signal is needed between
transmitter and receiver devices.
GND is relative, and if separate GND signals are used, there might be a relative
difference between the two that might be significant enough to cause a logic 1.


2. (2 points) The baud rate (e.g. 9600 bps) is the rate at which 1's and 0's
are transmitted over the serial line.  Briefly explain why the data rate (rate
at which useful data is transmitted/received) is less than the baud rate even
with error-free transmission.
The baud rate contains extra bits, which are the start and stop bits, which tells
the Arduino when to start reading in the data bits and when to stop.
