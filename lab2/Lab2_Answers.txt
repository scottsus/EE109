			  Lab 2 - Scopes and Signals

Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kHz", or "200 msec"

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (5 points) Fill out the following table for outputs A0 and A1. The duty
cycle of a signal is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the time the
signal is in the high state to the period of the signal.

    Bit  Time in 1 state   Time in 0 state    Period    Frequency    Duty cycle

    A0       1.00ms             1.16ms        2.16ms      463Hz         0.537

    A1       6.60ms             0.94ms        7.54ms      133Hz         0.875



2. (2 points) What is the range of the width of the A2 pulse that you observed?

    Narrowest:     0.330ms

    Widest:        3.000ms


3. (2 points) What is the approximate time delay from the input to the output
of the NOT gate?

        7.5 nanoseconds

4. (5 points) Fill in the table below with the input voltages to the 74HCT04
inverter and the resulting output voltage,

   Input voltage        Output voltage
        0.0                  4.99V
        0.2                  4.99V
        0.4                  4.99V
        0.6                  4.99V
        0.8                  4.99V
        1.0                  4.99V
	1.1                  4.99V
        1.2                  4.98V
	1.3                   0V
        1.4                   0V
	1.5                   0V
        1.6                   0V
        1.8                   0V
        2.0                   0V
        3.0                   0V
        4.0                   0V
        5.0                   0V



			  ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Suppose you wanted to measure the frequency of a note played by
a piano and sensed from a microphone connected/viewed on an oscilloscope.
Answer the following True/False questions with a brief explanation.

     a. True/False: To measure the frequency, the vertical scale of the
     oscilloscope would be of more use than the horizontal scale.
     False. Frequency is a measure of the Period, which is observed through the
     horizontal scale.

     b. True/False: Since the note is played for a short time period, we
     should set the triggering to "Single" rather than "Run".
     True. We want to capture the large change in voltage instead of observing the
     voltage pattern.

     c. True/False: If the signal ranges between 0V and 2.5V, the trigger
     level should ideally be set around 1.25V.
     True. 1.25V is set in the middle of the signal range, and thus the
     oscilloscope should be centered about the point in which the voltage changes.


2. (2 points) Each scope probe has a short black ground wire attached to it.
Why is it necessary to connect this to the circuit's ground point in order to
make a measurement?

Since voltage is measured across 2 points, we are essentially measuring the
potential difference of the circuit relative to ground, which is why we need the
ground connection in the first place.


3. (1 point) If you have used the Horizontal Position control to move the
trigger point horizontally so much that you can no longer see the trigger point
on the screen, what is the quick way to restore the trigger point back to the
middle of the screen?

We can simply press the horizontal position knob near the top of the controls.
