Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kOhm", or "200 mV".

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (1 point) What voltage did the DMM measure?
        DMM =  2.579V


2. What are the values of the resistors?  List the values from smallest to
   largest.
   (1.5 points) From the color bands:
	R1 =  240 ohms
	R2 =  680 ohms
	R3 =  1300 ohms
         
   (1.5 points) The measured values:
        R1 =  238 ohms
        R2 =  676 ohms
        R3 =  1279 ohms


3. (2 points) In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what
   are the CALCULATED voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.30V
        V2 =  3.70V


4. (2 points) In the circuit with Vs=5V and resistors R1 and R2 in series what
   are the MEASURED voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.30V
        V2 =  3.70V


5. (1 points) What are the voltages (or range of voltages after watching for a
few seconds) on the switch output when it is not pressed and when it is
pressed?
        Not pressed =  floating
        Pressed =  0V


6. (1 points) With resistor R2 added to the circuit, what are the voltages on
   the switch output when it is not pressed and when it is pressed?
        Not pressed =  5V
        Pressed =  0V


7. (2 points) Using the values you just measured for the voltages across R1 and
R3, and the values you measured previously for those resistor values, use Ohm's
Law to calculate the current that was passing through the resistors in both
cases.
                  Voltage     Resistance     Current
        R1:        5.00V       238 ohms      0.021A
        R3:        3.07V       1279 ohms     0.002A

8. (2 points) What were the values that you measured with the DMM in current
mode for the current flowing through the LED for both R1 or R3?
	          Current
	R1:       0.020A
        R3:       0.002A


			  ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Given the digital circuit you built with the button, inverter and
LED, suppose as you test it the output LED is always OFF regardless of the
button position.  For each of the following possible explanations, write a
sentence that explains why that issue would cause the LED to always be
off.

     a. VDD was not connected to the IC chips.
        There is no power supply to operate the inverter to convert the Logic 0 to Logic 1, thus
        disabling the LED from ever lighting up.

     b. The ground connection for the button was not connected appropriately.
        Because there is no ground connection on the LHS, current will always flow to the RHS toward
        the IC. That constantly produces a Logic 1, which is inverted by the IC into a Logic 0, thus
        never allowing the LED to light up.

     c. The LED was plugged in backwards.
        LED's only operate in a single direction (from anode to cathode).




2. (2 points) Given two resistors Rlo and Rhi whose resistance values are such that Rlo < Rhi

     a. If they are connected in series giving a series effective resistance of
     Reff, which of the following is true?
         Reff < Rlo
         Rlo < Reff < Rhi
         Rhi < Reff             true

     b. If they are connected in parallel, giving a parallel effective
     resistance of Reff, which of the following is true?
         Reff < Rlo             true
         Rlo < Reff < Rhi
         Rhi < Reff


3. (1 point) True or False: Ohm's Law applies to both LEDs and resistors.
        False.
