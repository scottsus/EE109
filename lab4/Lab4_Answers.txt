			 Lab 4 - Using the LCD Display

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1 (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device. To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page. Go to section
14.2 and read over page 85. Note that "toggle" means flip to its opposite
value, regardless of current value.

What effect does writing a 1 to a PIN register bit have? Consider, how this
might be used to generate the E signal pulse in your lcd_writenibble()
function. Re-write the 3 lines of code you had to generate the E signal pulse
for about 250 ns using the feature of writing a 1 to a PIN register bit. You
may leave the middle line that is intended to simply delay as is. So just show
the first line (statement) that turns the E signal on and then the last line
that turns it off. Make sure you use the correct register, masking, etc.


PINB |= (1 << PB1);
PORTB |= (1 << PB1);  // original line to simply delay
PINB |= (1 << PB1);

The first line toggles the value of PORTB1
The second line sets PORTB1 to a Logic One
The third line sets PORTB1 to a Logic Zero


2. (1 point) Suppose we need to perform 3 concurrent tasks intermittently: Task
A every 20 ms, Task B every 15 ms, and Task C every 40 ms. What delay should be
used on each iteration of the main loop?
 
 5ms.
