Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.
  a) For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and prescalar
     of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?
  b) With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest amount of time
     we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.

  a) 16MHz / 64 = 250,000
     2000 / 250,000 = 0.008 or 8ms

  b) 16MHz / 8 = 2MHz
     2^8 = 256Hz
     256 / 2,000,000 = 0.000128s or 0.128ms



2. We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to understand the operation of a device. To that end,
   open the ATmega328/P datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page. The TIMER1 we have used also
   has the ability to make an output pin turn ON (set), OFF (clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the OCR1A value
   (i.e. in addition to generating an interrupt, the hardware can automatically toggle or turn an output on or off).

   By searching the data sheet and using the information in section 16.11.1 (especially table 16-1) answer the following questions:
   a) Which two pins can TIMER1 (the 16-bit) timer control (i.e. what pins are associated with OC1A and OC1B).
      Look at Figure 1.1 (upper right diagram of the "28 PDIP" package) on page 12 of the data sheet, or Table 14-3, 14-6, or 14-9 to find this info.
   b) In this lab we use TIMER1 in the 'Clear Timer on Compare' or CTC mode. In this mode when the counter reaches
      the value in OCR1A register it generates an interrupt and starts counting again from zero. Using the information in section 16.11.1 and table 16-1,
      describe what the OC1A and OC1B pins would do when the timer reaches the OCR1A value if during initialization we used the statement TCCR1A |= 0x60;?

   a) PB1 and PB2

   b) TCCR1A |= 0x60 writes COM1A0 and COM1B1 to one. From Table 16-1, if the WGM13:0 bits are set to a CTC mode,
      we observe that OC1A/OC1B are set to Compare Match (set output to high level), which is likely saying that if the timer reaches the OCR1A value,
      the associated pin (PB1) will be set to high.
