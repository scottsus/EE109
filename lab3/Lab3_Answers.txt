Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit 2.
Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

The 3 buttons would not be using their internal pull-up resistors and an external
pull-up resistor set up would be required.



2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.

The way we detect the button press through checkInput() is in the while loop. In turn,
the while loop is constantly looping over itself infinitely, eternally checking for the
checkInput() to be true. When we press the button, we can be at any point in the loop.
If we happened to press the button when the while loop has already passed over the
checkInput() for that button, then we have to wait for another iteration of the loop for
any code to execute. For that reason, there will be variations in the propagation delays.
