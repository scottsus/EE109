		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) Briefly explain why it is undesirable to read the two encoder
input signals with two separate PINC statements.
There is a possibility that the time gap between reading the first and the second
input signal happens to coincide with the change in state of the encoder input signals,
causing erroneous readings for the input signal.


2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.
Updating the LCD display is a time-consuming process. Given that an interrupt is undesirable
to override another interrupt, updating the LCD in the ISR might potentially mean that
another ISR would not be called during this period, thus leading to some loss of information.
